# Topcoder Event RestHooks UI

This UI is generated by create-react-app package.

## Dependencies

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v8+)

## Configuration

As application uses Topcoder authorization we have to run it on the one of allowed domains. For development purposes we can use `localhost:3000`. So before run we have to add into `hosts` file the line `127.0.0.1 localhost`. Be aware, that we also have to run on the port `3000` to be able to authorize when run locally.

Configuration is at `src/config/config.js`.
The following parameters can be set in config file:

- API_URL: the API URL prefix
- TC_AUTH_URL: th url of Topcoder auth form,
- ACCOUNTS_APP_CONNECTOR: the url to TC account connector,
- APP_URL: URL of app
- RESTHOOK_FILTER_MAX_LENGTH: the max length for REST hook filter code
- TC_ADMIN_ROLE: the TC admin role name
- PAGE_SIZE: the page size
- CONFIRM_HOOK_TIMEOUT: confirm hook timeout in milliseconds
- RESTHOOK_HEADERS_COUNT: REST hook headers max count
- REQUIRE_HTTPS_HOOK: whether hook requires HTTPS, if true then only HTTPS hook is allowed, otherwise any endpoint is allowed

Run the application at `http://localhost:3000`
