# Topcoder Event RestHooks UI

This UI is generated by create-react-app package.


## Dependencies
- nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/ (v8+)


## Configuration
As application uses Topcoder authorization we have to run it on the one of allowed domains. For development purposes we can use `local.topcoder-dev.com:3000`. So before run we have to add into `hosts` file the line `127.0.0.1 local.topcoder-dev.com`. Be aware, that we also have to run on the port `3000` to be able to authorize when run locally.

Configuration is at `src/config/config.js`.
The following parameters can be set in config file:
- API_URL: the API URL prefix
- TC_AUTH_URL: th url of Topcoder auth form,
- ACCOUNTS_APP_CONNECTOR: the url to TC account connector,
- APP_URL: URL of app

Run the application as http://local.topcoder-dev.com:3000
